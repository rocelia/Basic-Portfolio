<!-- one to two paragraphs aobout myself -->
My name is Rocelia Cooper and I am a Client Services Manager for DB Schenker, an International Freight Forwarding Company. Working in logistics requires me to wear many hats. I direct and manage international export activities for several clients headquartered within the mid-west region spanning several states while obtaining a high level of customer service.
It is my responsbility to oversee international customs related activites including timely preparation of Bills of Lading, Certificate of Origins, Packing Lists, etc. I am constantly monitoring and negotiating export rates/servies in an effort to reduce costs. Providing stellar customer service is what sets us apart from other companies in this industry and I am researching and resolving customer complaints on sales, service, and operational issues on a daily basis to maintain a close partner relationship.

A couple of months ago, I made an executive decision that it was time I make a drastic change in my life. I tossed around the idea to enroll in the University of Denver's Coding Bootcamp. Fast forward to now and I have begun classes to change my
future and enter into a completely different career - hopefully for the better. The International Freight Forwarding industry can be extremely exciting at times, but I have reached my limit and no longer have a 
sense of fulfilment day in and day out. Rather than going into work everyday hoping for a better outcome, I took it upon myself to grab my life by the horns and challenge myself 
in hopes that I will ultimately have control of my future. I want my daily work to be rewarding and I believe the world of wed development will help me achieve that.
